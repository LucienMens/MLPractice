This repo is detailing my journey learning ML. 

I will be experimenting with Kaggle data, redoing a final project to
add ML, using Kaggle's materials for now, and eventually move onto 
creating my own models with data I either create through webscraping 
or keep using Kaggle. We shall see, as this is mostly to develop my 
skills.
